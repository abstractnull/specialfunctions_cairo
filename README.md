# Special functions of mathematical physics for Cairo-lang

The special functions of mathematics - of physical origin - are ubiquitous in the mathematical modeling of many, many domains and ontologies of current interest (and in their on-chain future incarnations, thanks to Cairo-lang!). All these areas, from classical mechanics to finance to applied number theory, will benefit from a robust library of numerical methods that implement a number of these functions.
We will start working with the classical special functions such as Î“(Gamma), Bessel, Airy, etc...

V0.1 18/04 Working Gamma/LogGamma in both Lanczos/Windschitl approximations for real part(in fixed point math). Approximation ok.

TODO: Implement Beta as Gamma related fn/Psi and newest approximations like Nemes' etc. Extend to complex valued Gamma, etc.

Actual scope: This project is part of a general research on compact numerical methods in acccordance to Cairo architecture constraints.
