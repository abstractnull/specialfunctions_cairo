# Special functions of mathematical physics for Cairo-lang

The special functions - of physical-mathematics origin - are ubiquitous in the mathematical modeling of many, many domains/ontologies of current interest (and in their on-chain horizons, thanks to Cairo-lang!). All these areas, from classical mechanics to finance to applied number theory, will benefit from a robust library of numerical methods that implement a number of these functions.
We will start working with the classical special functions such as Γ(Gamma), Bessel, Airy etc...
